# Hang out with your friends

![Hang out with your friends at your home rock.](<../.gitbook/assets/Home\_01 (1).png>)

## Meet your friends in virtual reality.

Is it your turn to host? Hold your D\&D game night in an actual dungeon. Have drinks around a campfire. Invite your date to chill in your treehouse and tell you how sweet it is.

* **Make your rock the place to be.** Customize a ready-to-play space or design your own from scratch.
* **Entertain your guests.** Snuggle up and watch a movie. Maybe throw a karaoke party.
* **Meet in 3D on desktop or VR.** Jump into your virtual body and get everyone in the same room.
