  Your personal website on the 3D web is where people can find you, in person.
  Maybe in your fancy apartment, all jazzed up with NFT swag. Maybe hanging out
  in your beach hut with your favorite people.

## Meet in person.

**Escape the Zoom-bie apocalypse.** Sometimes it’s just better to be in the same room. Remember what it’s like to talk together, instead of at each other?

**Create a cooler space to Hangout**. Invite friends to visit your penthouse in the metaverse instead of a screen in your garage. Deck the walls with your favorite NFTs.

**Meet in your metaverse, not Meta’s.** Host anyone, do anything – your house, your rules. Connect in your very own corner of the the 3D web and experience a freer way to meet online.
