  Free yourself from the tangle of neverending Slack threads and be in the same
  room as your distributed team – be it a boardroom, breakroom, or breakout
  room. Whatever your team needs today.

# Slack → 3D Office

![Friday afternoon in the office.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-03-09 at 5.15.45 PM.png>)

## Be in the same room as your distributed team.

**Feel closer to your team.** Be fully present at work and play. Host a fully immersive meeting then pop by the break room to see who's keen for a game of foosball.

**Make networking more fun.** Invite a prospective partner or employee to grab coffee in your 3D office. Explore a more enjoyable way to build new relationships.\
\
**Break the ice.** Have a remote coworker you've never met in real life? Ditch the introductory Slack message for a virtual game of beer pong.\
