# Build the 3D web

Rove is the easiest way for anyone to build a presence in the new 3D web – a network of 3D websites that are immersive, real-time, and persistent. \
\
Creating interactive 3D/VR environments is as simple as applying a website template. Every template can be customized to the creator's liking – all drag and drop, no code required.&#x20;
