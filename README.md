  Rove is the easiest way for anyone to build a presence in the new 3D web – a
  network of 3D websites that are immersive, real-time, and persistent. No
  coding experience or design skills are required.

# What is Rove?

Creating rich 3D environments is as simple as applying a website template. Build a 3D store for your customers – tomorrow’s Shopify. A 3D gallery for clients – tomorrow’s Behance. Or simply a 3D home people can visit – your personal website!

## What is the 3D web?

Tomorrow’s web is an **infinitely expanding network of 3D websites**. These 3D websites are **immersive**; they give you a sense of presence. They are **persistent**; their states are saved and synced among all Rovers. They are **real-time**; they are being rendered constantly to all devices accessing them, whether that’s a VR headset or a basic smartphone.

In the 3D web, visitors become inhabitants. They participate rather than passively consume.&#x20;

Every website on Rove is user-created. The basic building blocks for Rovers to create 3D web presences are [metaverses](broken-reference), [rocks](broken-reference), [environments](broken-reference), and [objects](broken-reference).

## You own the 3D web.

We don’t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions. We need to open the internet so everyone can own a piece.

**Rove gives creator abilities to anyone with a vision.** Through a [bottom-up design approach](https://whitepaper.rove.to/rove/the-3d-web/rocks#a-bottom-up-approach-to-nft-design), the community can create any web presence they can imagine – a personal website, a community forum, an online store, a client portfolio, etc.

**Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not Rove.** Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over what they create, represented by cryptographic non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unstoppable smart contracts are used to program relationships between these assets.

**Everything in Rove is permissionless by design.** Anyone can create their own website and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.
