# Browse the 3D web

Tomorrow’s web is an **infinitely expanding network of 3D websites**. These 3D websites are **immersive**; they give you a sense of presence. They are **persistent**; their states are saved and synced among all Rovers. They are **real-time**; they are being rendered constantly to all devices accessing them, whether that’s a VR headset or a basic smartphone.

In the 3D web, visitors become inhabitants. They participate rather than passively consume.&#x20;
