# Browse the 3D web

## An infinite network of 3D websites.&#x20;

3D websites are **immersive**; they give you a sense of presence. They are **persistent**; their states are saved and synced among all Rovers. They are **real-time**; they are being rendered constantly to all devices accessing them, whether that’s a VR headset or a basic smartphone.

In the 3D web, visitors become inhabitants. They participate rather than passively consume.&#x20;

## Rove is the gateway to the 3D web.

Each website is someone’s address. Rove allows you to visit these 3D homes, stores, galleries, offices, and community spaces – and create your own place to call home.
