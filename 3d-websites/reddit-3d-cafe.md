  Make a 3D home for your community – a space they can literally build together,
  and hang out in. A web3 cafe for modern day intellectuals and meme-artists to

## Make a 3D home for your community.

**Meet the 3D human behind the keyboard.** People are more than their usernames. Debate a stranger, jump in on an ongoing conversation, possibly make a new friend.

**Host immersive live experiences.** Host your next AMA in 3D/VR and bring your international community together in virtual real life.

**Let your community build itself.** Every environment on Rove can be shaped by its inhabitants. It’s a more organic way to create a shared space, and more fun to come back to.
