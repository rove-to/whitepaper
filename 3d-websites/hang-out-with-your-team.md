# Hang out with your team

![Ain't no party like an office party.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

## Be in the same room as your distributed team.

Take a break from the scheduled tyranny of conference calls. Just pop by the break room to see who's keen for a chat, or a game of foosball.\

**Create a common space for hybrid teams.** Is everyone in different places today? Let's do lunch in virtual reality.\
\
**Get to know new humans.** Have a remote coworker you've never met in real life? Ditch the introductory slack message for a virtual game of beer pong.&#x20;

**See your favorite coworkers again.** Hang around the 3D watercooler in your new avatars. This could not have been an email.\
