# Behance → 3D Gallery

## Show your art in the metaverse.

**Make your portfolio jump off the page.** Simply create your 3D gallery in any style you want and bring the walls, floors, and ceilings alive with your work.

**Sell your work on your terms.** There are no curator fees to be paid here – you’re the gallerist after all. Set your price and let the native payment system handle the rest.\
\
**Easily host intimate and public events.** Invite your network from all over the world to meet with you in your very own gallery. Personally introduce collectors to your art.&#x20;
