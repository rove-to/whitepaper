  Free yourself from the tangle of neverending Slack threads and be in the same
  room as your distributed team – be it a boardroom, breakroom, or breakout
  room. Whatever your team needs today.

# Slack → 3D Office

![Ain't no party like an office party.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

## Be in the same room as your distributed team.

**Teams are closer on the 3D web.** Be fully present at work and play. Finish up a meeting and pop by the break room to see who's keen for a chat, or a game of foosball.

**Networking is more fun in the metaverse.** Invite a prospective partner or employee to grab coffee in your 3D office. Explore a more enjoyable way to build new relationships.\
\
**Get to know new humans.** Have a remote coworker you've never met in real life? Ditch the introductory Slack message for a virtual game of beer pong.\
