# 3D Templates

![Potential types of web presences on Rove.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rHPYUVnnLEB4o6t2IzGs-VOqoPb2m5Qyob7BbvE8rHOrrIXbBxnJcpfc4JmQHFJttgXis0Dfe77xxRVxWZXyvBr\_bt\_P9C\_7OV4NvXtabUCbWR3CnZOvDeXOt3qGZgDFTgmzhJTo)

Rove will launch with customizable templates for a 3D home, store, gallery, and community space. These environments are a reimagnining of their web2 counterparts, designed to help users take their personal websites, online stores, portfolios, and forums into the new web.

Initially built by [the core team](../the-community/meet-the-core-team.md) to demonstrate possibilities, the community will later be able to create their own templates for other Rovers to use.

## Which attributes do websites use?

The first websites will be built on Voronoi rocks, using a few Voronoi attributes as basic primitives.

* **Diameter:** The diameter attribute indicates the capacity of a website. The larger the rock is, the more visitors it can host.
* **Complexity:** The more complexity a rock has, the more complex an experience it can host. For example, a low-complexity rock might only support a small hangout and be perfect for a group of friends, but rock with higher complexity might be needed to host a large-scale VR event.
* **Gravity:** Social experiences in VR will use the gravity attribute to hang out while bending physics.
