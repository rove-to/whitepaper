# Own the 3D web

**Everything in Rove is permissionless by design.** Anyone can create their own website and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.

**Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not Rove.** Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over what they create, represented by cryptographic non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unstoppable smart contracts are used to program relationships between these assets.
