# Trustless P2P commerce

Everything in the Rove System is permissionless by design. Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not the Rove system.&#x20;

Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over their assets, represented by cryptographic **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs).&#x20;

Buying and selling assets are done via trustless **smart contracts**.

## The Rove Marketplace

Within Rove, every piece of user-created content is an NFT asset. Assets that can be bought and sold on the Rove Marketplace include:

* [Metaverses](../the-3d-web/metaverses.md)
* [Rocks](../the-3d-web/rocks/)
* [Environments](../the-3d-web/environments.md)&#x20;
* [Objects](../the-3d-web/objects.md)
* [Experiences](../3d-websites/3d-templates.md)

And more as Rove evolves.
