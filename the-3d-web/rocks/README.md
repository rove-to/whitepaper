# Rocks

Rocks are where and how things happen in each [metaverse](../metaverses.md). Rocks are foundations for Rovers to build, host, and participate in [social](../../3d-experiences/experiences.md), gaming, commerce, work, and learning experiences.

Rocks have attributes common to their local metaverses – such as density, size, color, location, and gravity. These attributes shape how Rovers create and participate in experiences.

Rocks are NFTs within Rove.

## A bottom-up approach to NFT design

Typically, products employ a top-down approach. These products are designed for specific problems or purposes. We see this in many in-product NFTs. For example, a game could define various specific in-game NFTs for its players.

Rove takes a bottom-up approach. Rocks are general-purpose NFTs. They are not tied to a single experience, product, or game. They are foundations for Rovers to build different experiences on top of.

Think of Rock attributes as basic primitives that can be used in infinite ways – like a deck of cards. Creators can interpret these attributes however they like to build unique and engaging experiences – like Blackjack or Poker.
