# 3D website templates

![Potential types of web presences on Rove.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rHPYUVnnLEB4o6t2IzGs-VOqoPb2m5Qyob7BbvE8rHOrrIXbBxnJcpfc4JmQHFJttgXis0Dfe77xxRVxWZXyvBr\_bt\_P9C\_7OV4NvXtabUCbWR3CnZOvDeXOt3qGZgDFTgmzhJTo)

Rove will launch with customizable templates for 3D homes, stores, galleries, and community spaces. These environments are a reimagining of their web2 counterparts, designed to help users take their personal websites, online stores, portfolios, and forums into the new web.

Initially built by [the core team](../the-community/meet-the-core-team.md) to demonstrate possibilities, the community will later be able to create their own templates for other Rovers to use.
