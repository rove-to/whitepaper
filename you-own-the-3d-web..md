# You own the 3D web.

We don’t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions. We need to open the internet so everyone can own a piece.\

**Rove gives creator abilities to anyone with a vision.** Through a bottom-up design approach, the community can create any web presence they can imagine – a personal website, a community forum, an online store, a client portfolio, etc.

**Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not Rove.** Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over what they create, represented by cryptographic non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unstoppable smart contracts are used to program relationships between these assets.

**Everything in Rove is permissionless by design.** Anyone can create their own website and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.
